    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Shri Narendra Damodardas Modi life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1950</strong> - Born in Gujarati family in Vadnagar</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1971</strong> - He became a full-time worker for the RSS
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1985</strong> - The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2001</strong> - Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2014</strong> - Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party a majority in the Indian lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since 1984
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2017</strong> - He began a high-profile sanitation campaign, initiated a controversial demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2019</strong> - Following his party's victory in the 2019 general election, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. His administration also introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, which resulted in widespread protests across the country. Described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his alleged role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.[d]
